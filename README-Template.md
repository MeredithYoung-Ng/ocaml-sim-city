# Ocaml Sim City

Open Ended University-building simulator built using Ocaml, with GUI support provided by the Lablgtk2 library. Modeled after earlier versions of Sim City (originally by Maxis Software). Created for the Cornell CS 3110 (Functional Programming and Data Structures) final project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. We assume a working installation of Ocaml 4.05+ to start- if you don't have that on your system, an installation guide for all systems can be found [here](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html).

### Installing

The project itself has three primary external dependencies needed:
* Lablgtk2 (http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/)
* Async (From Jane Street Capital: https://github.com/janestreet/async)
* Yojson (From Martin Jambon: https://github.com/mjambon/yojson)

Installation of each should be pretty easy through your system's default Ocaml package manager.

## Build

Run the game through the "Make Run" command- our makefile is included. Enjoy!
